Replacing cdc_ string
You can use vim or perl to replace the cdc_ string in chromedriver. See answer by @Erti-Chris Eelmaa to learn more about that string and how it's a detection point.
Using vim or perl prevents you from having to recompile source code or use a hex-editor.
Make sure to make a copy of the original chromedriver before attempting to edit it.
Our goal is to alter the cdc_ string, which looks something like $cdc_lasutopfhvcZLmcfl.
The methods below were tested on chromedriver version 2.41.578706.

Using Vim
    vim /path/to/chromedriver
    After running the line above, you'll probably see a bunch of gibberish. Do the following:

    Replace all instances of cdc_ with dog_ by typing :%s/cdc_/dog_/g.
    dog_ is just an example. You can choose anything as long as it has the same amount of characters as the search string (e.g., cdc_), otherwise the chromedriver will fail.
    To save the changes and quit, type :wq! and press return.
    If you need to quit without saving changes, type :q! and press return.

Using Perl
    perl -pi -e 's/cdc_/dog_/g' /path/to/chromedriver

Wrapping Up
    grep "cdc_" /path/to/chromedriver

Example
cd .cache/selenium/chromedriver/linux64/100.0.4896.60/
cp chromedriver /home/zaripov/IdeaProjects/Vote/src/resources/unix/
perl -pi -e 's/cdc_/dog_/g' chromedriver
